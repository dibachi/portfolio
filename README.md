# Welcome to my portfolio!
 
ðŸš§UNDER CONSTRUCTIONðŸš§

I'm glad you took the time to check this out. I used to have a Wix site, but I found effectively illustrating my work on there to be troublesome. I'm hoping this repository proves
more elegant and more true to my organizational style. If you're reading this, feedback is appreciated!

My work experience, skills, and educational history are summarized on my [resume](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/blob/main/Jack%20Dibachi%20Resume%2009_2021.pdf). I speak at length about each of my projects, jobs, and internships in their respective folders within this repository.

For example, to look at some of my major projects in undergrad, you can check out my work with the [UCSB Hyperloop team](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/UCSB%20Hyperloop) and [UCSB Rocket Propulsion Laboratory](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/Rocket%20Propulsion%20Laboratory). Some of my smaller UCSB projects and reports have documentation [here](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/UCSB%20Projects%20and%20Reports).

You can find more of my internship and work experience here:
