# Welcome to my portfolio!

This repo serves as a portfolio of my side projects, student teams, and work I've done in undergrad and grad school. Organizing my porfolio on GitHub is a new thing for me, and is still under construction, so feedback is appreciated!

My [resume](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/blob/main/Jack%20Dibachi%20Resume.pdf) summarizes my skills and the most pertinent projects I've worked on, but I speak at length about all of my past work in their respective folders here.

For example, to look at some of my major projects in undergrad, you can check out my work with the [UCSB Hyperloop team](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/UCSB%20Hyperloop), [UCSB Rocket Propulsion Laboratory](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/Rocket%20Propulsion%20Laboratory), and my time as a Research Assistant with the [UCSB Department of Physics](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/LZ%20Dark%20Matter%20Collaboration). Some of my smaller UCSB projects and reports have documentation [here](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/tree/main/UCSB%20Projects%20and%20Reports).

As a first year Master's student, my work here at Stanford is just getting started, but there are big things to come! I have many projects I'm excited to share here when I finish the quarter in December, specifically in autonomous driving and reinforcement learning for bipedal robots, so stay tuned!
