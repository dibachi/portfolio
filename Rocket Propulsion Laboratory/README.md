# Rocket Propulsion Laboratory

I started the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (RPL) at UCSB with a classmate in my third year. Our mission statement was to provide academic and career opportunities to students interested in aerospace, as our school did not have an aerospace engineering program. To center our work around a project, we decided to compete in the [FAR/Mars Launch Contest](https://friendsofamateurrocketry.org/far-mars-launch-contest/), a collegiate rocketry competition with the goal of launching a rocket to 45,000 feet. Our rocket, which uses liquid oxygen and liquid methan as propellants, consists of a composite ablative engine, pintle fuel/oxidizer injector, cryogenic propellant feed system, helium pressurization system, valve controls and avionics, and recovery system using a self-deploying parachute.

After designing our concept rocket, we had to test the rocket engine and propulsion system with a static fire test, which would ensure the engine thrust is consistently up to spec for the duration of the flight. During my senior year, we began design and fabrication of the static fire test rig used to test the rocket propulsion system.

This test rig consists of numerous components going on the rocket, as well as additional plumbing and sensors for conducting other component and system tests. As chief engineer of the team, I was responsible for all aspects of the test rig, including writing the [static fire test rig design packet](https://github.com/dibachi/portfolio/blob/main/Rocket%20Propulsion%20Laboratory/RPL_Static_Fire_Test_Stand_Design_Packet.pdf) but I worked directly on sensor integration and valve controls.
