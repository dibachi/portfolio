# Rocket Propulsion Laboratory

I started the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (RPL) at UCSB with a classmate in my third year. Our mission statement was to provide academic and career opportunities to students interested in aerospace, as our school did not have an aerospace engineering program. To center our work around a project, we decided to compete in the [FAR/Mars Launch Contest](https://friendsofamateurrocketry.org/far-mars-launch-contest/), a collegiate rocketry competition with the goal of launching a rocket to 45,000 feet.
